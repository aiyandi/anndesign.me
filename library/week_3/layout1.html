                <p>CSS is getting a set of entirely new properties that, when used together, allow you to define grids for your web content to go onto. These properties are defined in the CSS Grid Layout specification.</p>
				
                <p>CSS hasn’t particularly been known for its ability to handle complex layouts. Although this may not have been a problem when CSS first came out, it has evolved to be a pretty common one over the years, as all sorts of complex layouts couldn’t be easily implemented. People have been very creative at getting around the lack of support by using floats or absolute positioning and a variety of CSS layout frameworks emerged.</p>

                <p>So it’s about time CSS got some proper layout solutions to support today’s use cases.</p>
