                <strong>Where do we find our dogs?</strong>
                <p>Pet adoption usually refers to the process of taking guardianship of and responsibility for a pet that a previous owner has abandoned or released to a shelter or rescue organization. Common sources for adoptable pets are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Animal shelters, in the case of dogs also known as dog pounds</li>
                    <li>Pets found loose or stray without identification, and which are unclaimed by any owner</li>
                    <li>Advertisements placed by individuals trying to find a new home for their pet</li>
                    <li>Pets that have been abused or neglected and have been confiscated from the offending owner.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Dogs adopted from shelters are often referred to as shelter dogs or pound puppies; dogs adopted from rescue organizations are often called rescued dogs or rescue dogs.</p>
